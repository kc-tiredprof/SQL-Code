Title

Creation of Budget vs. Actual Summary Query by Object Description

System

Financial Reporting (General Ledger)

Purpose

This change introduces a new query to summarize budget allocations, actual spending, and remaining balances by object description. The goal is to support financial monitoring, reporting, and decision-making by providing a high-level view of spending categories.

Business Need

Previously, reports required manual aggregation or multiple steps to determine remaining balances across object categories. This solution automates the process and ensures:

All budget lines are included, even if no spending has occurred.

Spending and allocations are summarized correctly.

Financial leaders can quickly identify remaining funds or overspending.

This approach is particularly relevant for institutions using enterprise resource planning platforms such as Ellucian.

Code Implemented
select  
    od.ob_description as Item, 
    sum(fmb.b_appr_mdebits) as Total_Allocated,
    coalesce(sum(fma_total.spent), 0) as Total_Spent,
    sum(fmb.b_appr_mdebits) 
      - coalesce(sum(fma_total.spent), 0) as Remaining
from f26_m_budget fmb
inner join ob_descs od 
    on od.ob_descs_id = right(fmb.gls_id, 5)
left join (
    select 
        gls_id,
        sum(mdebits) as spent
    from f26_m_actuals
    group by gls_id
) fma_total
    on fma_total.gls_id = fmb.gls_id
where fmb.gls_id like 'budget number here%'
group by od.ob_description
order by od.ob_description;
Impact

Improves financial reporting accuracy.

Reduces manual work.

Supports transparency and accountability.

Can be reused for other departments or budget segments.

Testing and Validation

The query was tested to confirm:

All budget lines appear in the output.

Categories without spending return a value of zero.

Spending totals match transactional reports.

No duplication occurs when multiple transactions exist.
